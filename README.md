# GetData012-CourseProject

This is the Repository with my code for performing analysis on the UCI HAR dataset as part of the Course Project in "Getting &amp; Cleaning Data" offered by Coursera.

## Steps to be followed :

1) Download the zip file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and extract the contents. The Dataset folder is "UCI HAR Dataset"

2) R script "run_analysis.R" should be placed in the parent folder of "UCI HAR Dataset", and the same parent folder should also be set as the working directory for R.

3) Run source("run_analysis.R"), this will generate a new file "tiny_data.txt" in the working directory. (approx. size of 262 kb)
